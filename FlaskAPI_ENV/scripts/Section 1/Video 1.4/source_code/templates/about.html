<h2>About the Sample Application</h2>

<p>During the course we will create a RESTful web API which could be used by a Professional Head
    Hunting company, storing data about professions, candidates, jobs, clients, contracts and
    preferences. </p>
<p>Using the Web API the reader can build frontend applications for different platforms
    (website and applications for smartphones and tablets).</p>
